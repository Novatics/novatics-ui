## Getting started with Novatics UI

Here is an example of a basic app using Novatics UI's `CurrencyTextField` component:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import CurrencyTextField from '@novatics/currency-text-field';

function App() {
  return (
    <CurrencyTextField
      value={123456}
      onChange={() => {
        /* setup on change */
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

In this [playground](https://components.novatics.com.br/?path=/docs/currency-textfield--playground), try changing the props and see how it affects the output and the code.
